IDEAS:

Using items is a mess, they have their own states.
  - Isolate scene actions and item actions. Up to three item actions per turn, using an auxiliary model to generate outcomes, then the next scene generates automatically.
  - Make the status a free-form string. May be more versatile than Active/Inactive.
