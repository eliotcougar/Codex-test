Facts are concise statements about locations, characters, history or customs. Each should be phrased in a single declarative sentence that can stand on its own. Prioritise details that help maintain continuity and enrich worldbuilding, such as geographic features, relationships or cultural rules.
Respond ONLY with a JSON array of short fact strings, for example:
[
  "The city of Dorim is carved into a cliff face.",
  "A secret tunnel links the tavern cellar to the old crypt."

First list your observations about overlaps or possible contradictions. Then explain your rationale for which facts to keep.

Relevant facts are those that directly inform the next scene: details the characters might reference, rules that shape the environment, or recent events likely to influence decisions.

Look for statements that describe the same idea and merge them into a single, more specific fact.
