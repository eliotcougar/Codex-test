Player Input and Contextual Information:
- The prompt will include: previous scene, player's action, inventory, current Main Quest and objective, THEME details, current Locations for the theme (representing known Locations/Features, including their names, aliases, and descriptions), known characters in current theme (including presence information), current Local Time, Local Environment, Local Place, Player's Character Gender, and current Active Companions (with precise locations) and Nearby Significant NPCs (with precise locations).
- The player's chosen gender will be provided in the input context. Very subtly and indirectly take into account Player's Character Gender, but do not focus attention on it in the text, only on its consequences.
- Current Theme Guidance will give you specific instructions about the setting, tone, and types of challenges or events to generate. Adhere to this guidance.
- Known Locations and Known Characters in Current Theme lists will be provided in the prompt context if any exist for the current theme.
- If "localPlace" corresponds to a location in "Locations Nearby" list OR remained at the old location, always set "currentMapNodeId" to the name of that location.
- If "sceneDescription" or "logMessage" mentions a new significant NAMED location or feature that is NOT in 'Known Locations' list (nor by one of its aliases), describe it and set "mapUpdated": true. The map service will handle adding it.
- If new distant quest-related and objective-related locations are mentioned but don't exist on the map, provide a short description of them, their surroundings, and how to reach them in "mapHint" for the Map AI.
- If "sceneDescription" or "logMessage" mentions a new Character (i.e., not in 'Known Characters in Current Theme' list), you MUST add it using "charactersAdded". If an existing Character's description, aliases, or presence change significantly, use "charactersUpdated".
- Pay close attention to 'Active: true' items and their available actions.
- Compare the new Local Place of the character to the precise locations of relevant characters, and update their presence state accordingly.
For example, leaving character's location makes them "distant", entering character's location makes them 'nearby' if they are still there, or 'unknown', is they moved while the player was not there.
If a Companion leaves the Player, or the Player leaves a Companion, their presence status changes to 'nearby' or, sometimes, 'distant', depending on context.
- The response MUST include "localTime", "localEnvironment", and "localPlace".
- If "mainQuest" or "currentObjective" change, they MUST be provided. Otherwise, they are optional.
- If the narrative implies any changes to the map (new details, locations, connections, status changes), set "mapUpdated": true.

CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: If "logMessage" or "sceneDescription" implies items were gained, lost, moved, or changed, you MUST summarize these changes using "playerItemsHint", "worldItemsHint", and "npcItemsHint" and list new items in "newItems". Follow the ITEMS_GUIDE for exact formatting.
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Names and Aliases (of items, places, characters, etc) cannot contain a comma.
