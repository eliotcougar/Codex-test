Player Input and Contextual Information:
- Very subtly and indirectly take into account Player's Character Gender, but do not focus attention on it in the text, only on its consequences.
- Current Theme Guidance gives you specific instructions about the setting, tone, and types of challenges or events to generate. Adhere to this guidance.
- If "localPlace" corresponds to a location in "Locations Nearby" list OR remained at the old location, always set "currentMapNodeId" to the name of that location.
- If "sceneDescription" or "logMessage" mentions a new significant NAMED location or feature that is NOT in 'Known Locations' list (nor by one of its aliases), describe it in "mapHint", and set "mapUpdated": true. The map service will handle adding it.
- If new distant quest-related and objective-related locations are mentioned but don't exist on the map, provide a short description of them, their surroundings, and how to reach them in "mapHint" for the Map AI.
- If "sceneDescription" or "logMessage" mentions a new NPC (i.e., not in 'Known NPCs in Current Theme' list), you MUST add it using "npcsAdded". If an existing NPC's description, aliases, or presence change significantly, use "npcsUpdated".
- Pay close attention to 'Active: true' items and their available actions.
- Compare the new Local Place of the Player to the precise locations of relevant NPCs, and update their presence state accordingly.
For example, leaving NPC's location makes them "distant", entering NPC's location makes them 'nearby' if they are still there, or 'unknown', is they moved while the player was not there.
If a Companion leaves the Player, or the Player leaves a Companion, their presence status changes to 'nearby' or, sometimes, 'distant', depending on context.
- The response MUST include "localTime", "localEnvironment", and "localPlace".
- If "mainQuest" or "currentObjective" change, they MUST be provided. Otherwise, they are optional.
- If the narrative implies any changes to the map (new details, locations, connections, status changes), set "mapUpdated": true and write about it in mapHint.
- If Player's Action is "Inspect: [item_name]": Provide details about the item in "logMessage". If new info/use is found, mention it in playerItemsHint.
- If Player's Action is "Attempt to use: [item_name]": Treat it as the most logical action. Describe the outcome in "logMessage". If specific function is revealed, mention the new knownUse in playerItemsHint.

CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: If "logMessage" or "sceneDescription" implies items were gained, lost, moved, or changed, you MUST summarize these changes using "playerItemsHint", "worldItemsHint", and "npcItemsHint" and list new items in "newItems". Follow the ITEMS_GUIDE for exact formatting.
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Names and Aliases (of items, places, NPCs, etc) cannot contain a comma.
