Creatively generate variations of the main quest and current objective based on the suggestions, but make them noticeably different.
Creatively generate the initial scene description, action options, and items (variations based on 'Initial Inventory to be granted'), along with a logMessage.
Creatively add any important quest item(s), if any, based on your generated quest and objective.
ALWAYS SET "mapUpdated": true.

- If no items are anachronistic, no transformation is needed.

Generate the scene description for a disoriented arrival, and provide appropriate initial action options for the player to orient themselves.

  - CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: ALWAYS transform some items into important quest items you must have already had in this reality, based on Main Quest, Current Objective, or the Adventure Summary even if they are NOT anachronistic, using an "itemChange" "update" action with "newName" and optional "type" and "description". Creatively explain this transformation in the "logMessage".

Describe the scene as they re-enter, potentially in a state of confusion from the shift, making it feel like a continuation or a new starting point consistent with the Adventure Summary and current quest/objective.
Provide appropriate action options for the player to orient themselves.
The response MUST include at least the "mainQuest", "currentObjective", "localTime", "localEnvironment", and "localPlace".
Set "mapUpdated": true if your generated Scene, Quest or Objective mention specific locations that should be on a map or if existing map information needs updating based on the re-entry context.
